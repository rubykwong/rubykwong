## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ruby (they/them), a full-stack software developer. After nearly 7 years of working in the charity sector, in April this year I decided to retrain in web development through a Software Development Bootcamp with Northcoders. I've been learning a range of front and back-end skills, listed below :point_down:

I'll be looking for full-time junior roles from July 2025!

## Coding skills & languages
